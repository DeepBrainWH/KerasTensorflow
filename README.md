# KerasTensorflow
keras backend Tensorlow tutorial

## Environment
    ununtu16.04 (this is my operate system, maybe you can run these code in you windows OS or Mac OS, it is not having a strict restricting)
    python 3.6
    tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0 (or tensorflow cpu)
    keras
    cuda-9.0
    cudnn-7
You can install them by:
  pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.0.0
  pip install keras
  (I assum that you have already installed and have an correct environment of cuda and cudnn.
    if not, please search how to install cuda and cudnn)
  

In this repository, you will learn how to use keras backend Tensorflow to process some simple porblem,
such as :
  recognizing handwritten digts
  classify cafir image data
  and so on.
